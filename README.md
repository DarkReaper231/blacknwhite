## Use BetterDiscord and Spicetify at your own risk, these are violations of their terms of services


These dotfiles might work out of a box on Manjaro i3 community edition
Also this like my home folder so everything I have here is in my home folder


## Programs I use

```BetterDiscord, Spicetify, Xcursor, Nautilus, cava, rofi, Polybar, i3-gaps, i3-scrot, picom-ibhagwan-git, neofetch, code-oss, gtk-3.0```
and a lot of others... you can see them in i3 config tho


## Theme for Visual Studio

[Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=viktorqvarfordt.vscode-pitch-black-theme)


## Some additional install steps

If you want the Nautilus theme to be running you will have to build it on your own from folder themes/phocus.
You have to get the files from [this repo](https://github.com/phocus) as I only provided modified build files in this repo


## Steps you should do after installing

1. Get openwheathermap.org API and modify weather.py in polybar
2. Also polybar might not work for you out of a box, make sure the screen output is set to your current one
3. Read through the config files, because something might be different for you
4. Make sure you have fonts Inconsolata, Dejavu Sans Mono, TerminessTTF Mono, MonacoB
